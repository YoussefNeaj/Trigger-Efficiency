Efficiency vs Lifetime vs Mass

There are two textfiles for lifetime:

- Lifetime.txt: Contains the actual lifetimes (0,1,4,10,30)
- Lifetime2.txt: Converts each lifetime to a corresponding number (0 -> 0, 1 -> 1, 4 -> 2, 10 -> 3, 30 -> 4).

mass.txt contains the masses of Charginos of each sample.

efficiency.txt contains the efficiency of HLT_XE110_pufit_LX50 for each sample.

efficiency.C calculates the efficiency of HLT_XE110_pufit_LX50 for each sample.

eff.h is the header file used.
